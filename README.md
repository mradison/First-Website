# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I created this websit so I could practice working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- I am new to software development and coding. I wanted to do this to start learning and practicing new skills. 
- This website makes it easy to know what I need to study to prepare for the bootcamp.
- I learned that technology is powerful if you learn how to harness it and make it work for you.

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide can be used by any new student or person who wants to know what coding languages are used to make a website. Each section contains notes about each topic that is addressed in the Prework Module - like: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. If you open the DevTools console you can see JavaScript running (this is probably my favorite part of the website).
